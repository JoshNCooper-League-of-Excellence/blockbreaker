Plan:
  The plan is to make a simple block breaker. just a 2D grid of blocks, and you can break away and place blocks on the grid.
  Create a tiny game in C with Raylib, assuming we know nothing about C.
  Use a super simple build system, no over complications.
  Unity build.
  
Setup: 
  [x] Acquire raylib. [https://github.com/raysan5/raylib.git]
      depends on CMake.
      
  [x] Acquire a C compiler (clang) # platform specific, Arch (it's the same for most linux distros, just a different package manager.)
      On arch: `sudo pacman -S clang`
      On mint: `sudo apt install clang`
      On windows: download the clang compiler from their website and run the installer.

  [x] Make a build script.
  [/] Create our files / get assets.

Boilerplate:
  [x] Initialize raylib.
  [x] Drawing test.

Game:
  [x] Setup grid system
  [x] Draw textures and colored cubes on the grid.
  [x] Implement breaking / placing logic, Handle mouse input and events, on click, etc.
  [x] Add chunks
  [x] Add selected block thing
  [ ] Add serialization and deserialization logic.
